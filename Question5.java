    Question 5 :
    (Asked in Accenture OnCampus 11 Aug 2021, Slot 2)

    Implement the following Function 

    def differenceofSum(n. m)

    The function accepts two integers n, m as arguments Find the sum of all numbers in range from 1 to m(both inclusive) that are not divisible by n. Return difference between sum of integers not divisible by n with sum of numbers divisible by n.

    Assumption:

    n>0 and m>0
    Sum lies between integral range
    Example

    Input :     n:4
                m:20
    Output :    90

    Explanation

    Sum of numbers divisible by 4 are 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60
    Sum of numbers not divisible by 4 are 1 +2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 150
    Difference 150 â€“ 60 = 90

    Sample Input
    n:3
    m:10
    Sample Output
    19
